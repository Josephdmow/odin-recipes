# odin-recipes
This project marks the inception of my journey into HTML basics as part of The Odin Project course. Here, I intend to apply the foundational HTML knowledge I've acquired thus far. The website I'm crafting will feature a central index page housing links to several delectable recipes.

Initially, my focus lies solely on honing my HTML skills. Subsequently, I plan to return to this project and elevate its visual appeal through the incorporation of CSS.
